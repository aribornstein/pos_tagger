# POS/NER Tagger Code (Classical and Deep Learning)
A repository containing different implementations of POS and NER tagging that I wrote during my studies including:

- Greedy MLE
- Hidden Markov Model
- Greedy Max Entropy
- Max Ent Markov Model
- Pytorch Feed Forward
- Pytorch Feed Forward With Word Embeddings
- Pytorch Feed Forward With Word and Subword Embeddings
- Pytorch Bi-LSTM With Word Embeddings
- Pytorch Bi-LSTM With both word Embeddings and Char LSTM
